            I was born in Mongolia and studied in a math-focused class during
            high school. I studied Information Systems at the National
            University of Mongolia for 4 years. My interest in tech started
            early â€” back in middle school, I used to build blogs when platforms
            like Miniih.com and Gogo.mn were popular(iykyk). Now, with almost 4
            years of experience as a full-stack developer based in Ulaanbaatar,
            I enjoy turning complex problems into simple and easy-to-use
            solutions.
