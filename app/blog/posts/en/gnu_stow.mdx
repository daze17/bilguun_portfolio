## What is GNU Stow?

GNU Stow is a powerful tool for managing symlinks, particularly useful for organizing and deploying dotfiles. It allows you to keep a centralized repository of configuration files and easily create symlinks to them in your home directory.

### Key features:

1. **Symlink farm management**: Stow creates and manages symlinks from your dotfiles repository to your home directory.
2. **Modular organization**: You can group related configuration files into packages, making it easy to manage and deploy specific sets of dotfiles.
3. **Non-destructive**: Stow won't overwrite existing files, ensuring the safety of your current configurations.
4. **Version control friendly**: Since your dotfiles are centralized, you can easily track changes using Git or other version control systems.

## Why use GNU Stow for dotfiles?

1. **Simplicity**: Stow automates the process of creating and managing symlinks, reducing manual work.
2. **Flexibility**: You can easily add, remove, or modify dotfiles without affecting your entire setup.
3. **Portability**: Your dotfiles repository can be easily cloned and deployed on different machines.
4. **Cleanliness**: Keep your home directory tidy by centralizing all your dotfiles in one location.

### Directory looks like this:

```
home/
    dotfiles/
        .config/
            zsh/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
```

In the following sections, we'll explore how to set up and use GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles effectively.

1. Install stow

```
   brew install stow
```

2. Create a new dotfiles directory

```
   mkdir $HOME/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
```

3. Just in case copy the dotfiles from the original location. Let's try the example with .zshrc file

```
   mkdir ~/copy_dotfiles
   cp ~/.zshrc ~/copy_dotfiles/.zshrc
   cp -R ~/.config ~/copy_dotfiles/
```

4. Move files to the new location which is named ~/dotfiles/

```
   cd $HOME/dotfiles
   mv ~/copy_dotfiles/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/.zshrc
   mv ~/copy_dotfiles/.config ~/dotfiles/.config
```

4. Create symlinks

```
   stow -t . ~/dotfiles/.zshrc
   stow -t . ~/dotfiles/.config
```

OR

```
   stow -t .
```

5. Check the result

```
   ll -a
```

dotfiles directory
![dotfiles directory](/work/gnu_stow/dotfiles_directory.png)

old config directory
![old config directory](/work/gnu_stow/old_config_directory.png)

6. Git config

```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of dotfiles"
```
