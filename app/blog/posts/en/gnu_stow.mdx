How do we manage configuration files like `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, `.bashrc`, and other dotfiles?

When trying out new things, you've probably accidentally changed configurations that were working fine before.
Are the configurations different between your work and personal computers? Or when your computer data is lost, you'll need to reinstall all configurations again.

These issues can be solved using version control. However, since dotfiles are scattered throughout the system, using traditional git version control presents some challenges.

I solved this using GNU Stow.

# What is GNU Stow? Definition

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager, which means it helps manage your system configuration files by creating symlinks and storing everything in one place.
In other words, it connects configuration files in your HOME directory to files in another folder.
To put it simply, when you change a file in the HOME directory, the files in our newly created folder will change simultaneously.

## Key Features:

1. **Symlink farm management**: Stow helps manage configurations in your HOME directory by creating symlinks from your dotfiles folder.
2. **Modular organization**: Organizes dotfiles in modules making them easier to deploy.
3. **Non-destructive**: Stow won't overwrite existing files, making it safe for your current configuration files.
4. **Version control friendly**: Since files are centralized, it's easier to track changes using git version control.

Note that it will create the exact same structure as your configuration files in the HOME directory.

## The structure looks like this:

```
home/
    dotfiles/
        .config/
            zsh/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
```

Let's explore how to set up and use GNU Stow:

1. Install stow
If you use MacOS and have homebrew installed, simply run:

```
   brew install stow
```

2. Create a new dotfiles directory

```
   mkdir $HOME/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
```

3. To prevent issues, let's copy the original dotfiles. We'll test with .zshrc file.

```
   mkdir ~/copy_dotfiles
   cp ~/.zshrc ~/copy_dotfiles/.zshrc
   cp -R ~/.config ~/copy_dotfiles/
```

4. Move configuration files to the newly created ~/dotfiles/ directory.

```
   cd $HOME/dotfiles
   mv ~/copy_dotfiles/.zshrc ~/dotfiles/.zshrc
   mv ~/copy_dotfiles/.config ~/dotfiles/.config
```

5. Create symlinks

```
   stow -t . ~/dotfiles/.zshrc
   stow -t . ~/dotfiles/.config
```

Or

```
   stow -t .
```

6. Verify

```
   ll -a
```

If successful, it should look like this:

![dotfiles directory](/blog/gnu_stow/dotfiles_directory.png)

Our HOME directory will look like this:

![old config directory](/blog/gnu_stow/old_config_directory.png)

7. Git config

```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of dotfiles"
```

# Additional:
Ignore files

If you've configured version control, you'll have a `.git` file in your directory.
Don't worry about stow creating symlinks for `.git` files. Stow will automatically ignore `.git` files.

An unmodified stow ignore file looks like this:

![default_ignore](/blog/gnu_stow/default_ignore.png)

If you want to add additional changes, you can create `.stow-local-ignore` and add your modifications.
