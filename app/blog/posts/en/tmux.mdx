I love working with the command line. I think there’s hardly any more productive and versatile tool for a software developer than the terminal. The additional hacker/wizard/neckbeard kind of feeling you get when using a terminal comes for free, what’s not to love?

Over the years I’ve tried to streamline and customize my command line experience to be more convenient, more fun to use or just to look rad. One of the most important tools to drive my daily command line experience is tmux. Check this out:

# What is tmux?

tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them, and reattach them to a different terminal. tmux is most often used to run long-running programs, such as compilations or daemons, in a manner that doesn’t interrupt the use of the keyboard and mouse. The most popular use of tmux is in terminal-based text editors, where it allows you to edit a file in one terminal and have another open in another terminal window.

You see that tmux basically offers two big features:

1. Window management in your terminal
2. and session management

If you are familiar with GNU Screen this might all sound familiar. Think of tmux as an easier-to-use and a little more powerful alternative to Screen (obviously I’m being opinionated here).

Enough with the concepts. Let’s get our hands dirty!

# Installation

Fortunately installing tmux is pretty straightforward on most operating systems: a simple
`sudo apt-get install tmux` (Ubuntu, WSL and derivatives) or `brew install tmux` (MacOS) should be sufficient.

# Starting Your First Session

For your first session simply start tmux with a fresh session:

```
tmux
```
This will create a new tmux session with a nice all-green status bar at the bottom:

# Splitting Panes

Now that you have a session running, you can start splitting your terminal into multiple panes.
Panes are subdivisions within a tmux window - a window can contain multiple panes.
You can split your current pane into two with `Ctrl-b %` (`Ctrl-b` is the prefix key, which you can change in your `~/.tmux.conf` file).
This will split your window into two panes, one on the left and one on the right:

![tmux_split_panes](/blog/tmux/tmux_split_horizontal.png)

You also can split vertically with `Ctrl-b "` (where `"` is the double quote key) and horizontally with `Ctrl-b -` (where `-` is the minus key).

You can move between your panes with `Ctrl-b <arrow key>` (where `<arrow key>` is the arrow key you want to use). You can also resize your panes with `Ctrl-b <arrow key>` and `Ctrl-b -` (where `<arrow key>` is the arrow key you want to use).

# Detaching Panes

If you want to detach your window from your session, you can do so with `Ctrl-b d`. This will detach your window and you can reattach it to your session with `Ctrl-b c`.

# Creating Windows

If you want to create a new window, you can do so with `Ctrl-b c`. This will create a new window with a nice all-green status bar at the bottom:

# Moving Between Windows

If you want to move between windows, you can do so with `Ctrl-b <arrow key>` (where `<arrow key>` is the arrow key you want to use). You can also resize your windows with `Ctrl-b <arrow key>` and `Ctrl-b -` (where `<arrow key>` is the arrow key you want to use).

# Renaming Windows

If you want to rename your window, you can do so with `Ctrl-b ,` (where `,` is the comma key). This will bring up a prompt where you can enter

# Session Handling

If you’re done with your session you can either get rid of it by simply exiting all the panes inside or you can keep the session in the background for later reuse.

To detach your current session use `C-b d`. You can also use `C-b D` to let tmux give you a choice which of your sessions you want to detach.
Detaching from a session will leave everything you’re doing in that session running in the background. You can come back to this session at a later point in time.

To re-attach to a session and continue where you left you need to figure out which session you want to attach to first. List the currently running sessions by using

```
tmux ls
```
This will give you a list of all running sessions, which in our example should be something like

*0: 2 windows (created Sat Aug 15 17:55:34 2015) [199x44] (detached)*

To connect to that session you start tmux again but this time tell it which session to attach to:

```
tmux attach -t 0
```
Note that the `-t 0` is the parameter that tells tmux which session to attach to. “0” is the first part of your `tmux ls` output.

If you prefer to give your sessions a more meaningful name (instead of a numerical one starting with 0) you can create your next session using

```
tmux new -s database
```
This will create a new session with the name “database”.

You could also rename your existing session:

```
tmux rename-session -t 0 database
```
The next time you attach to that session you simply use `tmux attach -t database`.
If you’re using multiple sessions at once this can become an essential feature.

And that’s it! Congratulations, you’ve just completed your first tmux session and got your hands dirty with its window and session management.
Yes, there’s more stuff tmux can do. But what you’ve just learned should be everything to start using tmux in the future.


# Killing a Session

If you want to kill a session, you can do so with `Ctrl-b d`. This will kill the session and all of its windows.
