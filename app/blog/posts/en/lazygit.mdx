summary: "Lazygit, the convenience of GUI with the power of git CLI"
---

As a software engineer, I use Git and GitHub daily, and like many developers, I rely on Git CLI commands in the terminal for simple tasks because it's much quicker than using a graphical interface. However, when dealing with more complex or potentially risky operations, I switch to a UI for extra caution.

Lazygit has enabled me to work just as quickly as I would with standard CLI commands, but with the added clarity of a UI. Its standout feature is that it's entirely keyboard-driven — you never need to use your mouse while working with it.

# Using Lazygit

You can easily move between panels in the terminal UI using the arrow keys or vim-style shortcuts like `H`, `J`, `K`, and `L`. Some panels also have multiple tabs, which you can switch between using the square bracket keys. The only shortcut you really need to remember is `?`, which brings up a list of available actions depending on which panel or tab you're currently on.

The keybindings in lazygit are super intuitive — you can often figure them out just by thinking about the action you want to perform. For instance, pressing `c` commits changes when you're in the files panel, `n` creates a new branch or worktree depending on the context, `p` pushes your changes, and `o` opens a selected commit or file. And if something isn't obvious, just press `?` to bring up the context-aware help menu. Here's a quick demo where I stage a file, write a commit message, and force push it to the remote repo — all without leaving the keyboard.
