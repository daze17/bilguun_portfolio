## Energy Balance

The Energy Balance website is a professional and modern online platform I designed and developed for my mom's business. It reflects her company’s mission while providing a seamless user experience to its visitors. The site was built using cutting-edge web development technologies, including Next.js App Router, which ensures fast, smooth navigation and efficient server-side rendering for better performance and SEO.

I utilized Tailwind CSS to create a fully responsive and visually appealing design, maintaining consistency across different screen sizes while optimizing development speed. Shadcn was instrumental in building reusable and polished UI components, ensuring the site adheres to best practices in user interface design. The project also leverages the T3 Stack, combining powerful tools like TypeScript, Prisma, and TRPC for a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.

The website also utilizes AWS S3 for file storage and Neon DB for database management, showcasing the benefits of using serverless architecture and serverless databases.

## Admin Panel

The admin panel is a crucial component of the Energy Balance website, providing an interface for managing works, posts and images. The admin panel is authorized only for admin user.

By creating a separate admin panel, I ensured that the main website is more user-friendly for my mom in the long run.

## Conclusion

This project is particularly meaningful to me as it blends technical expertise with a personal connection. It was an opportunity to support my mom’s entrepreneurial journey by creating an online presence that effectively communicates her business values. From initial concept to final deployment, I prioritized intuitive navigation, clean design, and scalability to ensure the site meets her needs today and can grow with the business in the future.

The result is a professional, functional, and aesthetically pleasing website that stands out while remaining user-friendly. This project showcases my ability to develop full-stack applications that are both technically sound and aligned with the client’s vision.
